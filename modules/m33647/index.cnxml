      If we only had to worry about simple conductors, life would not
      be very complicated, but on the other hand we wouldn't be able
      to make computers, CD players, cell phones, i-Pods and a lot of other
      things which we have found to be useful.  We will now move on,
      and talk about another class of conductors called
      semiconductors.
    </para>
    <para id="understanding">In order to understand semiconductors and in fact to get a more
      accurate picture of how metals, or normal conductors actually
      work, we really have to resort to quantum mechanics.  Electrons
      in a solid are very tiny objects, and it turns out that when
      things get small enough, they no longer exactly following the
      classical "Newtonian" laws of physics that we are all familiar
      with from everyday experience.  It is not the purpose of this
      course to teach quantum mechanics, so what we are going to
      do instead is describe the results which come from looking at
      the behavior of electrons in a solid from a quantum mechanical
      point of view.
    </para>
    <para id="solids">Solids (at least the ones we will be talking about, and
      especially semiconductors) are crystalline materials, which
      means that they have their atoms arranged in a ordered
      fashion. We can take silicon (the most important semiconductor)
      as an example.  Silicon is a group 14(IV) element, which means it
      has four electrons in its outer or valence shell.  Silicon
      crystallizes in a structure called the diamond
      crystal lattice, shown in <link target-id="silicon"/>.
      Each silicon atom has four covalent bonds, arranged in a
      tetrahedral formation about the atom center.</para>

<para id="eip-878">In two dimensions, we can schematically represent a piece of
      single-crystal silicon as shown in <link target-id="twod"/>.  Each
      silicon atom shares its four valence electrons with valence
      electrons from four nearest neighbors, filling the shell to 8
      electrons, and forming a stable, periodic structure.  Once the
      atoms have been arranged like this, the outer valence electrons
      are no longer strongly bound to the host atom.  The outer shells
      of all of the atoms blend together and form what is called a
      band.  The electrons are now free to move about
      within this band, and this can lead to electrical conductivity
      as we discussed earlier.</para>

      This is not the complete story however, for it turns out that
      due to quantum mechanical effects, there is not just one band
      which holds electrons, but several of them.  What will follow is
      a very qualitative picture of how the electrons are distributed
      when they are in a periodic solid, and there are necessarily
      some details which we will be forced to gloss over.  On the
      other hand this will give you a pretty good picture of what is
      going on, and may enable you to have some understanding of how a
      semiconductor really works.  Electrons are not only distributed 
      throughout the solid crystal spatially, but they also have a distribution in energy
      as well.  The potential energy function within the solid is
      periodic in nature.  This potential function comes from the
      positively charged atomic nuclei which are arranged in
      the crystal in a regular array.  A detailed analysis
      of how electron wave functions, the mathematical
      abstraction which one must use to describe how small quantum
      mechanical objects behave when they are in a periodic potential,
      gives rise to an energy distribution somewhat like that shown in <link target-id="schematic"/>.</para>

<para id="eip-114">


      Firstly, unlike the case for free electrons, in a periodic solid,
      electrons are not free to take on any energy value they wish.
      They are forced into specific energy levels called allowed
      states, which are represented by the cups in <link target-id="schematic"/>. The allowed states are not distributed uniformly
      in energy either.  They are grouped into specific configurations
      called energy bands.  There are no allowed levels
      at zero energy and for some distance above that.  Moving up from
      zero energy, we then encounter the first energy band.  At the
      bottom of the band there are very few allowed states, but as we
      move up in energy, the number of allowed states first increases,
      and then falls off again.  We then come to a region with no
      allowed states, called an energy band gap.  Above the band gap,
      another band of allowed states exists.  This goes on and on,
      with any given material having many such bands and band gaps.
      This situation is shown schematically in <link target-id="schematic"/>, where the small cups represent allowed
      energy levels, and the vertical axis represents electron energy.
    </para>
   



<para id="allowedstates">It turns out that each band has exactly 2<emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis> allowed states in it, where <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis> is the total number of atoms in the particular crystal
      sample we are talking about.  (Since there are 10 cups in each
      band in the figure, it must represent a crystal with just 5
      atoms in it.  Not a very big crystal at all!)  Into these bands
      we must now distribute all of the valence electrons associated
      with the atoms, with the restriction that we can only
      put one electron into each allowed state.  This is
      the result of something called the Pauli exclusion
      principle.  Since in the case of silicon there are 4
      valence electrons per atom, we would just
      fill up the first two bands, and the next would be empty.  If
      we make the logical assumption that the electrons will fill in
      the levels with the lowest energy first, and only go into higher
      lying levels if the ones below are already filled.  This
      situation is shown in <link target-id="fullbands"/>, in which we have represented electrons as small black balls with a
      "-" sign on them.  Indeed, the first two bands are completely
      full, and the next is empty.  What will happen if we apply an
      electric field to the sample of silicon?  Remember the diagram
      we have at hand right now is an energy
      based one, we are showing how the electrons are distributed in
      energy, not how they are arranged spatially.  On this diagram we
      can not show how they will move about, but only how they will
      change their energy as a result of the applied field.  The
      electric field will exert a force on the electrons and attempt
      to accelerate them.  If the electrons are accelerated, then they
      must increase their kinetic energy.  Unfortunately, there are no
      empty allowed states in either of the filled bands.  An electron
      would have to jump all the way up into the next (empty) band in
      order to take on more energy.  In silicon, the gap between the
      top of the highest most occupied band and the lowest unoccupied
      band is 1.1 eV.
(One eV is the potential energy gained by an electron moving 
across an electrical potential of one volt.) 
    The mean free path or distance
      over which an electron would normally move before it suffers a
      collision is only a few hundred angstroms (<emphasis effect="italics">ca</emphasis>. 300 x 10<sup>-8</sup> cm)  and so you would need a very large electric field
      (several hundred thousand V/cm) in order for the electron to pick up enough energy to
      "jump the gap".  This makes it appear that silicon would be a
      very bad conductor of electricity, and in fact, very pure
      silicon is very poor electrical conductor.

      A metal is an element with an odd number of
      valence electrons so that a metal ends up with an upper band
      which is just half full of electrons.  This is illustrated in
      <link target-id="metal"/>.  Here we see that one band is full, and
      the next is just half full.  This would be the situation for the
      Group 13(III) element aluminum for instance.  If we apply an
      electric field to these carriers, those near the top of the
      distribution can indeed move into higher energy levels by
      acquiring some kinetic energy of motion, and easily move from
      one place to the next.  In reality, the whole situation is a bit
      more complex than we have shown here, but this is not too far
      from how it actually works.

      So, back to our silicon sample.  If there are no places for
      electrons to "move" into, then how does silicon work as a
      "semiconductor"?  Well, in the first place, it turns out that
      not all of the electrons are in the bottom two bands.  In
      silicon, unlike say quartz or diamond, the band gap between the
      top-most full band, the next empty one is not so large.  As we
      mentioned above it is only about 1.1 eV.  So long as the silicon
      is not at absolute zero temperature, some electrons near the top
      of the full band can acquire enough thermal energy that they can
      "hop" the gap, and end up in the upper band, called the
      conduction band.  This situation is shown in <link target-id="thermal"/>.

      <caption>Thermal excitation of electrons across the band gap.

<para id="eip-new3"> 
      In silicon at room temperature, roughly 10<sup>10</sup> electrons per cubic centimeter are thermally excited
      across the band-gap at any one time.  It should be noted that
      the excitation process is a continuous one.  Electrons are being
      excited across the band, but then they fall back down into empty
      spots in the lower band.  On average however, the 10<sup>10</sup> in each cm<sup>3</sup> of silicon is what you will find at any given instant.
      Now 10 billion electrons per cubic centimeter
      seems like a lot of electrons, but lets do
      a simple calculation.  The mobility of electrons in silicon is
      about 1000 cm<sup>2</sup>/V.s.  Remember, mobility times electric field yields the
      average velocity of the carriers.  Electric field has units of V/cm, so with these units we get velocity in cm/s as we should.  The charge on an electron is 1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> coulombs. Thus from <link target-id="eip-38"/>:</para>

<para id="eip-new5"> 
      If we have a sample of silicon 1 cm long by (1 mm x 1mm) square, it would have a resistance, <link target-id="eip-39"/>, which does not make it much of a "conductor".  In fact, if this
      were all there was to the silicon story, we could pack up and
      move on, because at any reasonable
      temperature, silicon would conduct electricity very poorly.
