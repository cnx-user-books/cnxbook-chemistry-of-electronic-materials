We then remove the remaining resist, and perform
      an activation/anneal/diffusion step, also sometimes called the
      "drive-in". The purpose of this step is two fold. We want to
      make the n-tank deep enough so that we can use it for our
      p-channel MOS, and we want to build up an implant barrier so
      that we can implant into the p-substrate region only. We
      introduce oxygen into the reactor during the activation, so that
      we grow a thicker oxide over the region where we implanted the
      phosphorus. The nitride layer over the p-substrate on the LHS
      protects that area from any oxide growth. We then end up with
      the structure shown in <link target-id="fig1"/>.

<para id="paranew22">
      Now we strip the remaining nitride. Since the only way we can
      convert from p to n is to add a donor concentration which is
      greater than the background acceptor
      concentration, we had to keep the doping in the substrate fairly
      light in order to be able to make the n-tank. The lightly doped
      p-substrate would have too low a threshold voltage for good
      n-MOS transistor operation, so we will do a
      <m:math>
	<m:msub>
	  <m:mi>V</m:mi>
	  <m:mi>T</m:mi>
	</m:msub>
      </m:math> adjust implant through the thin oxide on the LHS, with
      the thick oxide on the RHS blocking the boron from getting into
      the n-tank. This is shown in <link target-id="fig2"/>, where boron
      is implanted into the p-type substrate on the LHS, but is
      blocked by the thick oxide in the region over the n-well.
</para>

      <caption>V<sub>T</sub> adjust implant. </caption></figure>


<para id="paranew23">
      Next, we strip off all the oxide, grow a new thin layer of
      oxide, and then a layer of nitride <link target-id="fig3"/>. The
      oxide layer is grown only because it is bad to grow Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> 
      directly on top of silicon, as the different coefficients of
      thermal expansion between the two materials causes damage to the
      silicon crystal structure. Also, it turns out to be nearly
      impossible to remove nitride if it is deposited directly on to
      silicon.

      <caption>Strip of the oxide and grow a new nitride layer. </caption></figure>

<para id="paranew24">The nitride is patterned (covered with photoresist, exposed,
      developed, etched, and removal of photoresist) to make two areas
      which are called "active" <link target-id="fig4"/>. The wafer is then subjected to a
      high-pressure oxidation step which grows a thick oxide wherever
      the nitride was removed. The nitride is a good barrier for
      oxygen, so essentially no oxide grows underneath it. The thick
      oxide is used to isolate individual transistors, and also to
      make for an insulating layer over which conducting patterns can
      be run. The thick oxide is called field oxide (or
      FOX for short) <link target-id="fig5"/>.
</para>

<para id="paranew25">
      Then, the nitride, and some of the oxide are etched off. The
      oxide is etched enough so that all of the oxide under the
      nitride regions is removed, which will take a little off the
      field oxide as well. This is because we now want to grow the
      gate oxide, which must be very clean and pure <link target-id="fig6"/>. The oxide under the nitride is sometimes called a
      <emphasis effect="italics">sacrificial oxide</emphasis>, because it is sacrificed
      in the name of ultra performance.
</para>

      <caption>Ready to grow gate oxide. </caption></figure>


<para id="paranew26">
      Then the gate oxide is grown, and immediately thereafter, the
      whole wafer is covered with polysilicon <link target-id="fig7"/>.
 </para>

      <caption>Polysilicon deposition over the gate oxide. </caption></figure>

<para id="paranew27">
      The polysilicon is then patterned to form the two regions which
      will be our gates. The wafer is covered once again with
      photoresist. The resist is removed over the region that will be
      the n-channel device, but is left covering the p-channel
      device. A little area near the edge of the n-tank is also
      uncovered <link target-id="fig8"/>. This will allow us to add some
      additional phosphorus into the n-well, so that we can make a
      contact there, so that the n-well can be connected to
      <m:math>
	<m:msub>
	  <m:mi>V</m:mi>
	  <m:mi>dd</m:mi>
	</m:msub>
      </m:math>.

<para id="paranew28">
      Back into the implanter we go, this time exposing the wafer to
      phosphorus. The poly gate, the FOX and the photoresist all block
      phosphorus from getting into the wafer, so we make two n-type
      regions in the p-type substrate, and we have made our n-channel
      MOS source/drain regions. We also add phosphorous to the
      <m:math>

	  <m:mi>V</m:mi>
	  <m:mi>dd</m:mi>
	</m:msub>
      </m:math>
      contact region in the n-well so as the make sure we get good
      contact performance there <link target-id="fig9"/>.
</para>

<para id="paranew29">
    The formation of the source and drain were performed
      with a <emphasis effect="italics">self-aligning technology</emphasis>. This means that we
      used the gate structure itself to define where the two inside
      edges of the source and drain would be for the MOSFET. If we had
      made the source/drain regions before we
      defined the gate, and then tried to line the gate up right over
      the space between them, we might have gotten something that
      looks like what is shown in <link target-id="fig10"/>.  What's
      going to be the problem with this transistor? Obviously, if the
      gate does not extend all the way to both the source
      and the drain, then the channel will not
      either, and the transistor will never turn on! We could try
      making the gate wider, to ensure that it will overlap both
      active areas, even if it is slightly misaligned, but then you
      get a lot of extraneous fringing capacitance which will
      significantly slow down the speed of operation of the transistor
      <link target-id="fig11"/>. This is bad! The development of the
      self-aligned gate technique was one of the big breakthroughs
      which has propelled us into the VLSI and ULSI era.

<para id="paranew30">
      We pull the wafer out of the implanter, and strip off the
      photoresist. This is sometimes difficult, because the act of ion
      implantation can "bake" the photoresist into a very tough
      film. Sometimes an rf discharge in an O<sub>2</sub> 
      atmosphere is used to "ash" the photoresist, and literally burn
      it off the wafer! We now apply some more PR, and this time
      pattern to have the moat area, and a substrate contact exposed,
      for a boron p<sup>+</sup> implant. This is shown in <link target-id="fig12"/>.
</para>

<para id="paranew31">
      We are almost done. The next thing we do is remove all the
      photoresist, and grow one more layer of oxide, which covers
      everything, as shown in <link target-id="fig13"/>.  We put
      photoresist over the whole wafer again, and pattern for contact
      holes to go through the oxide. We will put contacts for the two
      drains, and for each of the sources, make sure that the holes
      are big enough to also allow us to connect the source contact to
      either the p-substrate or the n-moat as is appropriate <link target-id="fig14"/>.
